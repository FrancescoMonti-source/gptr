\title{Core lookup used inside gpt(): retrieve model IDs with caching policy.
Honors gptr.check_model_once (reuse forever in session) and gptr.model_cache_ttl (refresh after TTL).
If no cache or TTL expired, performs a live probe and refreshes the cache.
Returns a character vector of model IDs.
\itemize{
\item with provider+base_url: returns character vector (as before), with TTL/check-once policy.
\item with neither: returns a data.frame snapshot of ALL cached entries (no refresh).
\item with only provider: uses configured default base_url for that provider.
\item with only base_url: returns character vector, union of cached models at that root (any provider).
}}
\usage{
