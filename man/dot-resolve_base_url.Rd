\title{Encapsulates “given a provider and no explicit URL, what endpoint should we call?” logic.
It also honours a global gpt.local_base_url override. Even with a central resolver,
you still need a helper like this to construct a canonical URL for local calls.
In fact, in the resolver we suggested calling .resolve_base_url("auto", NULL)
to pick a generic local default when no backend is specified.
