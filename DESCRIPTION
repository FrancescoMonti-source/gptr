Title: High-Level R Interface to LLM APIs for Structured Text Extraction
Version: 0.4.1
Author: Francesco Monti
Maintainer: Francesco Monti <francesco.monti@outlook.it>
Description: Provides a set of high-level helper functions to interact with 
    local or remote Large Language Model (LLM) APIs using OpenAI-compatible 
    endpoints. Includes tools for sending prompts, handling conversation 
    history, extracting structured data from unstructured text, validating 
    against a user-defined schema, retrying failed extractions, and working 
    with both text and file/image inputs. Designed for reproducible, 
    schema-based extraction workflows in data analysis pipelines.
    Supports both local inference servers (e.g., LM Studio) and hosted 
    providers (e.g., OpenAI) via unified syntax.
